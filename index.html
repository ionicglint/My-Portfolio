<h2 id="10">Modules</h2>
<p>the modules that i did throughout the year helped with my subject choice and my career path, helped me better understand the historical events that helped to shape the political world as it is today.</p>

<h3>Careers</h3>
<p>In Careers we had to interview a person in a job that I was interested in. I interviewed Kevin McConnell a vet, I then typed up a transcript of the interview and handed it in</p>
<h3>Socio-Politics</h3>
<p>this module taught me about the way the history of our world has impacted the politcal status of the world today.</p>
<h3>Restorative Practices</h3>
<p>this module was very similiar to circle time in religion but it delved further into our feelings and our understanding of our emotions than religion did.</p>
<h3>Risk Assessment</h3>
<p>this module showed us the importance of safety and the need to have a well secured home and workplace, which would try to divert and prevent a criminal from breaking into either your home or workplace. </p>
